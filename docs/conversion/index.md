# Convert a font

Write a font in a different file format while keeping its characters. To keep
only selected text, [create a subset](../subsetting/index.md) first.

## Write a WOFF file

Place your source at `fonts/Inter-Regular.ttf`, create an `output` directory,
and run this script beside `vendor`. Use a destination that does not exist.

```php
<?php

require __DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php';

use Alto\Font\Font;
use Alto\Font\Writer\WoffWriter;

$font = Font::fromFile(__DIR__.'/fonts/Inter-Regular.ttf');
$destination = __DIR__.'/output/inter.woff';

new WoffWriter()->write($font, $destination);

printf("Saved inter.woff (%d bytes)\n", filesize($destination));
```

You now have `output/inter.woff`, ready to reference from your application.
WOFF compression is automatic. The original file is unchanged.

Running the script again with the same destination raises `FontWriteException`.
Choose a new path, or explicitly manage replacement in your application.
See [writer failures](writers.md#handle-failures) for other writing failures.

## Choose another output

| Desired file | Writer | Additional requirement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Standalone TrueType (`.ttf`) | `SfntWriter` | None |
| WOFF (`.woff`) | `WoffWriter` | None beyond the required Zlib extension |
| WOFF2 (`.woff2`) | `Woff2Writer` | A configured Brotli compressor |

Use the same load-and-write workflow with the selected writer. See
[Writers](writers.md) for TTF output and extracting a collection
face, or [Write WOFF2](../compression/woff2.md) for both Brotli options.

![One loaded Inter face is written as TTF, WOFF and WOFF2, with the same characters and measured output sizes.](../assets/figures/conversion.svg)

This fixture produces 66,912 bytes as TTF, 31,792 as WOFF, and 23,300 as WOFF2
with Brotli Maximum. No characters were removed. Other fonts and compression
versions can produce different ratios. [Measurement details](../reference/documentation-figures.md).

## What is preserved?

Conversion keeps the face's character and glyph data. Variable fonts retain
their axes; choosing a weight with `withVariations()` does not make that view
exportable as a static font.

Only supported TrueType outlines can be converted. Changing a file's extension
does not convert CFF outlines into TrueType. See [Formats](../formats.md).
Webfont container metadata and private blocks are not preserved when rewriting.
Details of reconstruction are in [Writers](writers.md).

Use `dump()` instead of `write()` when a storage API needs bytes rather than a
local file. Both are described in the [writer reference](writers.md).
