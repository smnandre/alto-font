# OpenType subsetting support

This reference describes the table-level limits of subsetting. Start with
[Create a subset](../subsetting/index.md) for a working example, or
[Choose subset options](../subsetting/policies.md) for application decisions.

## Compact glyph IDs

Compact mode renumbers retained glyphs and removes PostScript glyph names by
writing `post` format 3 when required. It rewrites supported `cmap`, horizontal
and vertical metrics, compound, GSUB, GPOS, GDEF, legacy `kern` format 0,
`gvar`, HVAR, and VVAR mapping structures. Any glyph-indexed table that cannot
be rewritten causes an explicit rejection.

GSUB compaction handles lookup types 1 through 8, including extension lookups.
GPOS compaction handles lookup types 1 through 9, with type 9 used for extension
lookups. Support for every lookup type does not imply support for every valid
font: the restrictions below still apply. OpenType Layout 1.1 feature
variations are preserved. GPOS positioning records retain valid Device and
VariationIndex data while their offsets are relocated. Non-NULL feature
parameters are supported for `size`, `ss01` through `ss20`, and `cv01` through
`cv99`; unknown parameter formats are rejected explicitly.

Oversized PairPos format 1 data is split across lookup subtables, including
within an existing PairSet at glyph-pair record boundaries. Both value records
and their Device or VariationIndex adjustments are retained. PairPos
format 2 removes unused classes and splits class rows when its internal
16-bit offsets would overflow. A row that still cannot fit is expanded into
format 1 glyph-pair records, split across subtables as needed. Implicit class
0 and Device or VariationIndex adjustments are preserved. A single pair record
with its adjustment data, or other layout structures, can still exceed their
offset limits and be rejected.

GDEF ligature caret values support formats 1, 2 and 3. Format 3 retains Device
or VariationIndex adjustments while relocating their offsets. The shared
variation store is rebuilt from its referenced structures, so it need not be
the final top-level subtable in the source GDEF table.

## Hinting tables

Dropping hinting removes glyph instructions and the related `cvar`, `cvt `, `fpgm`,
`prep`, `hdmx`, `LTSH`, and `VDMX` tables when `HintingPolicy::Drop` is selected.

## Layout tables

`LayoutPolicy::SubstitutionsOnly` keeps supported GSUB substitutions and their
required GDEF data while removing GPOS positioning. `LayoutPolicy::Drop`
removes GSUB, GPOS, and GDEF entirely.

This policy controls OpenType Layout tables. A legacy `kern` table is preserved
and remapped independently when its subtables use supported format 0.

## Variable fonts and unsupported structures

Supported variable TrueType subsets preserve all axes. Compact mode remaps
per-glyph `gvar` blocks and HVAR mappings while preserving supported axis data.
When `vhea` and `vmtx` are present, their glyph metrics are remapped together;
VVAR mappings are also remapped when present. The HVAR and VVAR
`ItemVariationStore` delta sets and their indexes are preserved. Their physical
layout is rebuilt without unrelated bytes or padding; unused delta sets are
not removed. This is not static instancing or axis-range reduction.

HVAR and VVAR mappings can precede or follow the variation store, including
gaps between its referenced structures. Shared mapping and variation-data
references are supported; overlapping structures are rejected. The store
copier preserves both ordinary and long-word delta encodings. This does not
extend support to other tables such as COLR that use long-word deltas.

A view created with `withVariations()` cannot be subsetted. Return to the
variable source with `withoutVariations()` first.

Compact mode still rejects `VARC`, `BASE`, color, bitmap, mathematical tables,
unsupported legacy kerning, and other glyph-indexed structures it cannot
remap. Private `meta` data is removed because its glyph references cannot be
remapped safely. Supporting `vhea`, `vmtx`, and VVAR does not imply general
vertical-layout support while those companion tables remain unsupported.

Always inspect `SubsetResult::$warnings` and validate the final output in the
environment that will shape and render it.

Preserving outlines and positioning does not guarantee identical rasterized
pixels. In the Recursive/CoreText validation sample, removing `post` glyph
names changes small-size rendering even when all other font data is retained.
Removing glyphs used by that renderer can also affect retained glyphs.

The [Recursive rendering diagnosis](https://github.com/altophp/font/blob/main/tests/Validation/RECURSIVE_RENDERING.md)
contains the reproducible CoreText evidence and the limits of its workaround.
